	abstract = {Elections seem simple—aren’t they just counting? But they have a unique, challenging combination of security and privacy requirements. The stakes are high; the context is adversarial; the electorate needs to be convinced that the results are correct; and the secrecy of the ballot must be ensured. And they have practical constraints: time is of the essence, and voting systems need to be affordable and maintainable, and usable by voters, election ofﬁcials, and pollworkers. It is thus not surprising that voting is a rich research area spanning theory, applied cryptography, practical systems analysis, usable security, and statistics. Election integrity involves two key concepts: convincing evidence that outcomes are correct and privacy, which amounts to convincing assurance that there is no evidence about how any given person voted. These are obviously in tension. We examine how current systems walk this tightrope.},

Elections were overturned because of fraud in CT, LA, NC, NJ and TX. Despite all efforts, a majority of the public have not had full confidence in election results for decades. Election offices need to build confidence by having and publicizing strong defenses. Thank-you notes for absentee ballots can tell voters how to report if they did not send the ballot. Webcasts of each step help detect problems. Audits of election counts check their accuracy. This paper covers mistakes, threats, rules for who votes absentee, and investigations of problems.},

	abstract = {The Fiat-Shamir transformation is the most efficient construction of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.



This paper is concerned with two variants of the transformation that appear but have not been clearly delineated in existing literature. Both variants start with the prover making a commitment. The strong variant then hashes both the commitment and the statement to be proved, whereas the weak variant hashes only the commitment. This minor change yields dramatically different security guarantees: in situations where malicious provers can select their statements adaptively, the weak Fiat-Shamir transformation yields unsound/unextractable proofs. Yet such settings naturally occur in systems when zero-knowledge proofs are used to enforce honest behavior. We illustrate this point by showing that the use of the weak Fiat-Shamir transformation in the Helios cryptographic voting system leads to several possible security breaches: for some standard types of elections, under plausible circumstances, malicious parties can cause the tallying procedure to run indefinitely and even tamper with the result of the election.

On the positive side, we define a form of adaptive security for zero-knowledge proofs in the random oracle model (essentially simulation-sound extractability), and show that a variant which we call strong Fiat-Shamir yields secure non-interactive proofs.

This level of security was assumed in previous works on Helios and our results are then necessary for these analyses to be valid. Additionally, we show that strong proofs in Helios achieve non-malleable encryption and satisfy ballot privacy, improving on previous results that required CCA security.},

This problem has been the greatest barrier to mainstream adoption of online voting systems, whether the voter receives the ballot online or by mail. Our conceptual breakthrough allows each voter, or their trusted associates (which we call “hedgehogs”), to “nullify” (cancel) their vote in a way that is anonymous, unstoppable, and irrevocable. The separate nulliﬁcation stage requires fewer assumptions than do other approaches, thereby strengthening security and increasing practicality, while simplifying and speeding up registration and vote casting. Though our nulliﬁcation technology can be readily applied to almost all types of elections for which the tally is publicly auditable online, its beneﬁts are greatest for votes cast beyond polling places, where the threat of improper inﬂuence is most acute. It addresses current trends: elections are moving online despite the growing ease by which voters can be paid and coerced electronically. Nulliﬁcation will help make it prudent to vote online, which is the type of voting advocates have long believed needed for democracy to reach its potential.},

Evaluate the steps needed to ensure that the online National Mail Voter Registration Form is accessible to people with disabilities, and 2. Identify barriers and publish recommendations to remove barriers preventing individuals with disabilities from voting. Five systemic barriers voters with disabilities face throughout the voting process for privately and independently voting are identified. Recommended actions to overcome these barriers and promote access to voting for voters with disabilities are described. In many cases, existing best practices and guidance are recommended to be broadly applied to voting systems and processes across the country. This publication also presents recommendations to address barriers identified in specific aspects of the voting process that includes voter registration and the National Mail Voter Registration Form, vote-by-mail, using voting technology for in-person voting, voting at polling locations, and training and documentation for poll workers.},

	abstract = {The Council of Europe’s Recommendation CM/Rec(2017)5 on e-voting remains the main international legal standard in the field. According to the updated Recommendation, e-voting should respect all the principles for democratic elections. This includes, of course, the principle of secret suffrage. Provisions on secret suffrage are dispersed throughout Rec(2017)5 and its related documents. The main provisions can be found in Section IV of Appendix I, but the principle is also mentioned in several other sections, in the Explanatory Memorandum, and in the Guidelines. A detailed analysis of all these provisions reveals important flaws in the understanding of secret suffrage in (remote) e-voting. Some of the flaws are the result of an inaccurate understanding of secret suffrage, in which this principle is mixed with provisions on personal data protection. In other cases, the flaws are due to analogies being drawn with paper-based voting channels, which prevent the standards from taking stock of the specificities of (remote) e-voting. In this paper I provide a detailed account of these flaws. I also suggest some alternative approaches and wording for the provisions on secret suffrage. Lastly, I discuss the desirability and feasibility of different alternatives regarding the review of Rec(2017)5.},

While the authors evaluated the general usability of their proposal, they did not evaluate its efficacy with respect to manipulation detection by voters. To close this gap, we conducted a corresponding user study. Furthermore, we study the effect of a video intervention (describing the vote casting process including individual verifiabilty steps) on the manipulation detection rate. We found that 65\% of those receiving the video detected the manipulation and informed the support. If we only consider those who stated they (partially) watched the video the rate is 75\%. The detection rate for those not having provided the video is 63\%. While these rates are significantly higher than the 10\% detection rate reported in related work for the original system, we discuss how to further increase the detection rate.},

We then formalise these rules in Coq. This reduces the gap between the legislation and formalisation so that, without knowledge of formal methods, one can still validate the process. Moreover our encoding is modular which enables us to capture other Single Transferable Vote schemes without signiﬁcant changes. Using the built-in extraction mechanism of Coq, a Haskell program is extracted automatically. This program is guaranteed to meet its speciﬁcation. Each run of the program outputs a certiﬁcate which is a precise, independently checkable record of the trace of computation and provides all relevant details of how the ﬁnal result is obtained. This establishes correctness, reliability, and veriﬁability of the count.},

We conclude that, for many vulnerabilities of Internet voting systems, there exist related weakness in paper systems as well. The main reason why paper-based elections are perceived as more secure is historical experience. We argue that recent criticisms of Internet voting have unfairly concentrated on the associated risks and neglected the benefits. Remote electronic voting lowers the cost of election participation and provides the most secure means for absentee voting. The latter is something that is urgently required in the contemporary, increasingly mobile world. Hence, we need to give Internet voting a chance, even if it means risking unknown threats and learning by trial and error.},

It is based on well-known cryptographic building blocks and relies on standard cryptographic assumptions, which allows for relatively simple security analysis. Our scheme is designed with a built-in fine-grained distributed trust mechanism based on threshold decryption. It, finally, imposes only very little additional computational burden on the voting platform, which is especially important when voters use devices of restricted computational power such as mobile phones. At the same time, the computational cost on the server side is very reasonable and scales well with the increasing ballot size.},

We consider a setting, in which voters receive personalized verification code sheets from the authorities over a secure channel. If the codes displayed after submitting a ballot correspond to the codes printed on the code sheet, a correct ballot must have been submitted with high probability. Our approach for generating such codes and transferring them to the voter is based on an existing oblivious transfer protocol. Compared to existing cast-as-intended verification methods, less cryptographic keys are involved and weaker trust and infrastructure assumptions are required. This reduces the complexity of the process and improves the performance of certain tasks. By looking at cast-as-intended verification from the perspective of an oblivious transfer, our approach also contributes to a better understanding of the problem and relates it to a well-studied cryptographic area of research.},

Each voter would then be able to “verify” their ballot on the public bulletin board, but the electronic tally would include alternative ciphertexts corresponding to the duplicate voters. We describe how this threat can be exploited and mitigated with existing STAR-Vote mechanisms, including STAR-Vote’s use of Benaloh challenges and a cryptographic hash chain. We also describe how this threat can be mitigated through statistical sampling of the printed paper ballots as an extension to the risk-limiting audits that STAR-Vote already requires.},

	abstract = {Modern electronic voting systems (e-voting systems) are designed to achieve a variety of security properties, such as verifiability, accountability, and vote privacy. Some of these systems aim at so-called tally-hiding: they compute the election result, according to some result function, like the winner of the election, without revealing any other information to any party. In particular, if desired, they neither reveal the full tally consisting of all (aggregated or even individual) votes nor parts of it, except for the election result, according to the result function. Tally-hiding systems offer many attractive features, such as strong privacy guarantees both for voters and for candidates, and protection against Italian attacks. The Ordinos system is a recent provably secure framework for accountable tally-hiding e-voting that extends Helios and can be instantiated for various election methods and election result functions. So far, practical instantiations and implementations for only rather simple result functions (e.g., computing the k best candidates) and single/multi-vote elections have been developed for Ordinos.

In this paper, we propose and implement several new Ordinos instantiations in order to support Borda voting, the Hare-Niemeyer method for proportional representation, multiple Condorcet methods, and Instant-Runoff Voting. Our instantiations, which are based on suitable secure multi-party computation (MPC) components, offer the first tally-hiding implementations for these voting methods. To evaluate the practicality of our MPC components and the resulting e-voting systems, we provide extensive benchmarks for all our implementations.},

This gives voters a simple way of verifying that their ballot was counted: they can simply look up their ballot/tracker pair on a public bulletin board. It is crucial to understand how trackers aﬀect other security properties, in particular privacy. However, existing privacy deﬁnitions are not designed to accommodate tracker-based voting systems. Furthermore, the addition of trackers increases the threat of coercion. There does however exist techniques to mitigate the coercion threat. While the term coercion mitigation has been used in the literature when describing voting systems such as Selene, no formal deﬁnition of coercion mitigation seems to exist. In this paper we formally deﬁne what coercion mitigation means for tracker-based voting systems. We model Selene in our framework and we prove that Selene provides coercion mitigation, in addition to privacy and veriﬁability.},

Cryptographic research has resulted in a number of proposals for protecting against such coercion with the help of counter-strategies that can be used by the voter to convince the coercer that they obeyed their instructions while secretly voting for another voting option. So far, these proposals have been theoretical, and their usability in terms of ability of the voter to apply the counter-strategies in practice has not been thoroughly investigated. We conducted a literature review to identify the available counter-strategies and assumptions on voters’ capabilities. We evaluated the identified assumptions and conclude a number of usability issues.

	abstract = {The BeleniosVS electronic voting scheme offers an attractive mix of verifiability and privacy properties. Moreover, using the ProVerif protocol-verification tool, BeleniosVS has automatic machine-aided analysis of (end-to-end) verifiability in 96 different threat models with the machine-aided analysis finding proofs in 22 cases and finding attacks in the remaining 74 cases. The high number of threat models covered by ProVerif delivers a much richer security analysis than the norm.

We revisit the BeleniosVS scheme and propose several refinements to the ProVerif security model and scheme which increase the number of threat models in which the scheme has verifiability from 22 to 28. Our new ProVerif security model also implies end-to-end verifiability but the requirements are easier to satisfy. Interestingly, in all six improvements, both the changes to the security model and one or more changes to the scheme are necessary to prove verifiability.},

However, these mechanisms are useless if not triggered by voters, who should not have to choose to either raise a dispute or keep their vote private. Hence, voting schemes should include privacy-preserving dispute resolution.In this work, we advance the formal analysis in the symbolic model of an improved version of the Bingo Voting scheme, whose enhancements include privacy-preserving dispute resolution mechanisms. Most of our analysis of several verification, dispute resolution, and privacy properties is done automatically using ProVerif, which we complement with manual induction proofs as necessary. We find that the scheme meets some properties only if one makes additional trust assumptions to those stated in 
[6]. For example, we find that dispute resolution is met assuming an honest voting authority. Moreover, our work provides an understanding of privacy-preserving dispute resolution in general, which can be beneficial to similar analyses of other voting schemes.},

It was formally proved to be secure, making the assumption that no further ballots are cast on the bulletin board after voters verified their ballots. In practice, however, revoting is allowed and voters can verify their ballots anytime. This gap between formal proofs and use in practice leaves open space for attacks, as has been shown recently. In this paper we make two simple additions to Belenios and we formally prove that the new version satisfies the expected verifiability properties.

We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability and user experience of such an approach: both the code sheets and the election webpage are based on usability research in this area but adopted for our idea.

However, not all the systems have adopted the same levels of verifiability nor the same range of cryptographic mechanisms. For instance, Estonia (2013) and New South Wales (Australia, 2015) started by adopting individual verifiability to their systems. Switzerland updated its regulation in 2014 to include individual and universal verifiability in order to by-pass the previous limitation of voting online up to 30\% of the electorate. Geneva and Swiss Post voting systems are adapting their systems to this regulation and currently provide individual verifiability (and universal in the case of Swiss Post). In this exploratory paper, we study the different approaches followed by the election organizers that offer online voting, their current status and derived future tendencies.},

	url = {https://hal.science/hal-03133412},
	abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates a new security primitive in the form of non-transferable ``visual secrets''. We show how they can be used in the design of voting systems. More specifically, we introduce a receipt-free low-tech visually verifiable boardroom voting system which is built for simplicity and can serve as a teaching tool to introduce people to verifiable voting. 
 
Visual secrets rely on the pre-semantic treatment of images in the human brain. After being shown an image for a limited time, users can recognise it in a larger set (79\% recognition compared to an expected baseline of 5\%). However, they cannot reliably communicate to someone else exactly how to do so (whether voluntarily or through coercion). Indeed, no assessor managed to accurately identify the images from the description given by the subjects. 

We then introduce a boardroom voting system based on this primitive. The voter receives a ballot consisting of a single picture, votes by folding it horizontally or vertically and casts it. If the voter is coerced into describing their ballot, several ballots are likely to correspond to the description. When all ballots are revealed, the voter can check with a glance that their ballot is present and folded correctly. This gives them the opportunity to detect error or fraud, although they cannot prove that fraud happened (the limited dispute resolution mechanism mainly focuses on incentives). 
The design makes use of textured paper to provide both accessibility for the blind and improved usability for all users.},

However, the concepts of the secret ballot and secret vote have strong ties to voting in a controlled environment in the polling station, and remote voting methods like postal voting or Internet voting need to employ special measures and approaches to achieve similar results. At the same time, limited options of observing the tallying process remotely potentially undermines the trust in remote voting. This paper looks at possible ways of giving the voter some feedback and assurance in the integrity of their vote, at the same time adhering to the freedom of voting principle.

This case describes how a previously trusted system can collapse, how paradoxical the relationship between trust and distrust is, and how it interacts with adopting and managing electoral technologies. The analysis stresses how, although being a central component, technology's trustworthiness dialogues with the socio-technical context in which it is inserted, for example, underscoring the relevance of public administration in securing technological environments. Beyond these insights, the research offers broader reflections on trust and distrust in data-driven technologies, advocating for differentiated strategies for building trust versus managing distrust. Overall, this paper contributes to understanding trust dynamics in digital government technologies, with implications for policymaking and technology adoption strategies.},

Protecting such systems from manipulation is challenging because of their distributed nature involving voters, election authorities, voting servers and voting platforms. An adversary corrupting any of these can make changes that, individually, would go unnoticed, yet in the end will affect the outcome of the election. It is, therefore, important to rigorously evaluate whether the measures prescribed by election verifiability achieve their goals. We propose a formal framework that allows such an evaluation in a systematic and automated way. We demonstrate its application to the verification of various scenarios in Helios and Belenios, two prominent internet voting systems, for which we capture features and corruption models previously outside the scope of formal verification. Relying on the Tamarin protocol prover for automation, we derive new security proofs and attacks on deployed versions of these protocols, illustrating trade-offs between usability and security.},

	url = {https://inria.hal.science/hal-01280445},
	abstract = {There have been intensive research efforts in the last two decades or so to design and deploy electronic voting (e-voting) protocols and systems which allow voters and/or external auditors to check that the votes were counted correctly. This security property, which not least was motivated by numerous problems in even national elections, is called verifiability. It is meant to defend against voting devices and servers that have programming errors or are outright malicious. In order to properly evaluate and analyze e-voting protocols and systems w.r.t. verifiability, one fundamental challenge has been to formally capture the meaning of this security property. While the first formal definitions of verifiability were devised in the late 1980s already, new verifiability definitions are still being proposed. The definitions differ in various aspects, including the classes of protocols they capture and even their formulations of the very core of the meaning of verifiability. This is an unsatisfying state of affairs, leaving the research on the verifiability of e-voting protocols and systems in a fuzzy state. In this paper, we review all formal definitions of verifiability proposed in the literature and cast them in a framework proposed by Küsters, Truderung, and Vogt (the KTV framework), yielding a uniform treatment of verifiability. This enables us to provide a detailed comparison of the various definitions of verifiability from the literature. We thoroughly discuss advantages and disadvantages, and point to limitations and problems. Finally, from these discussions and based on the KTV framework, we distill a general definition of verifiability, which can be instantiated in various ways, and provide precise guidelines for its instantiation. The concepts for verifiability we develop should be widely applicable also beyond the framework used here. Altogether, our work offers a well-founded reference point for future research on the verifiability of e-voting systems.},

It allows voters to verify that their vote was cast, and included in the final tally, as intended. User studies have shown that voters are unlikely to perform this verification, probably due to the effortful and cumbersome manual steps that are required by the system. To address this challenge, we propose, in this paper, two improvements: the first is to ameliorate the cumbersome nature of the verification process as much as possible. We offer two suggestions for doing this. To accommodate voters who have no interest in verifying, we propose a further improvement: delegation. This will allow voters to nominate a trusted third party to perform the verification on their behalf as and when they cast their vote. Hence no extra effort is required, and we can exploit existing trust in public institutions to provide voters with the assurance that the voting process is indeed honest and above board. In addition to providing end-to-end verifiability in a less effortful manner, we provide stored as cast and tallied as stored verifiability as well, for voters who do not wish to verify their own votes.},

Several important applications, such as secure e-voting, require that the employed mix net be verifiable. In the literature, numerous techniques have been proposed to make mix nets verifiable. Some of them have also been employed in politically binding elections. Verifiable mix nets differ in many aspects, including their precise verifiability levels, possible trust assumptions, and required cryptographic primitives; unfortunately, these differences are often opaque, making comparison painful. To shed light on this intransparent state of affairs, we provide the following contributions. For each verifiability technique proposed to date, we first precisely describe how the underlying basic mix net is to be extended and which (additional) cryptographic primitives are required, and then study its verifiability level, including possible trust assumptions, within one generic and expressive verifiability framework. Based on our uniform treatment, we are able to transparently compare all known verifiability techniques for mix nets, including their advantages and limitations. Altogether, our work offers a detailed and expressive reference point for the design, employment, and comparison of verifiable mix nets.},

We call a shuffle restricted if the permutation is chosen from a public subset of all permutations. In this paper, we introduce a general technique for constructing proofs of shuffles which restrict the permutation to a group that is characterized by a public polynomial. This generalizes previous work by Reiter and Wang [22], and de Hoogh et al. [7].},

	abstract = {We introduce a pre-computation technique that drastically reduces the online computational complexity of mix-nets based on homomorphic cryptosystems. More precisely, we show that there is a permutation commitment scheme that allows a mix-server to: (1) commit to a permutation and efficiently prove knowledge of doing so correctly in the offline phase, and (2) shuffle its input and give an extremely efficient commitment-consistent proof of a shuffle in the online phase.

We prove our result for a general class of shuffle maps that generalize all known types of shuffles, and even allows shuffling ciphertexts of different cryptosystems in parallel.},

	abstract = {Real-world elections often require threshold cryptosystems so that any t out of l trustees can proceed to tallying. This is needed to protect the confidentiality of the voters' votes against curious authorities (at least t+1 trustees must collude to learn individual votes) as well as to increase the robustness of the election (in case some trustees become unavailable, t+1 trustees suffice to compute the election result). We describe a fully distributed (with no dealer) threshold cryptosystem suitable for the Helios voting system (in particular, suitable to partial decryption), and prove it secure under the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Secondly, we propose a fully distributed variant of Helios, that allows for arbitrary threshold parameters l,t, together with a proof of ballot privacy when used for referendums.Our modification of Helios can be seen as revision of the seminal multi-authority election system from Cramer, Gennaro and Schoenmakers, upon which the original Helios system is based. As such, our work implies, to our knowledge, the first formal proof of ballot privacy for the scheme by Cramer et al. Thirdly, we provide the first open-source implementation of Helios with a fully distributed key generation setup.},
