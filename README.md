# NLP

This repository contains scripts, spreadsheets, source documents,
and other materials relevant to ensuring that the E2E-VIV
Cryptographic Protocol domain engineering model is complete with
respect to the background literature relevant to the project.

It includes a version of an NLP processing tool ([phrases](./phrases))
that extracts noun and verb phrases from text and PDF files, and was
originally developed at Galois by the BESSPIN team in 2019.

It also includes the raw output generated by the tool when run on the
sources listed in [sources.bib](./sources.bib), and when run on the 
current (as of 2 October 2024) draft of Wikstr√∂m's EVS book, as well 
as combined output for all sources. The sources themselves are not 
included for copyright reasons.
