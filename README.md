This repository contains scripts, spreadsheets, source documents,
and other materials relevant to ensuring that the E2E-VIV
Cryptographic Protocol domain engineering model is complete with
respect to the background literature relevant to the project.

It includes a version of an NLP processing tool ([phrases](./phrases))
that extracts noun and verb phrases from text and PDF files, and was
originally developed at Galois by the BESSPIN team in 2019.
